🎉 **Age Calculator Web App**

The Age Calculator is a simple, fully responsive web application that allows users to calculate their exact age in years, months, and days by simply selecting their birth date.

🔧 **Technologies Used**

*HTML5*	: Structure and input handling.            
*CSS3*	: Styling, layout, and responsiveness.    
*JavaScript* :	Dynamic behavior and age calculation logic.   


🚀 **How It Works**

1. *Input*
 
The user selects their birth date using a date picker input.

2. *Validation*
   
The JavaScript script restricts the user from selecting future dates to prevent invalid calculations.

3. *Calculation Logic*

The script extracts the day, month, and year from both the  current date and the selected birth date.

It handles date and month rollovers carefully to compute the correct age even when days or months are incomplete.

It adjusts calculations if the current day or month is less than the birth day or month.

4. *Display*
   
The final age is displayed in the format:

You are [X] years [Y] months [Z] days old.

The result is updated dynamically without refreshing the page.
